# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Aegis (repo name "ProtectIA") is a polyglot monorepo with three independent backend
services and one frontend, unified only by Docker Compose and CI — there is no shared
build system across languages. Comments, docstrings, and commit messages are
predominantly in Portuguese; match that when editing existing files.

```
apps/frontend/      React 19 + Vite + TypeScript — UI, WebAuthn/OAuth auth client
services/api-python/  FastAPI — main API: OAuth+WebAuthn auth, Cloudflare DNS, risk scoring
services/api-rust/    Axum — Postgres-backed service (currently a minimal skeleton)
services/api-dotnet/  ASP.NET (.NET 10) — minimal API skeleton
infra/scripts/         Maintenance scripts (cert expiry check, monorepo migration helper)
```

Each service manages its own dependency manifest and lifecycle (Poetry, Cargo, dotnet
CLI). The pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) covers only `apps/*`.

## Commands

### Root (pnpm)
```bash
pnpm install                # installs apps/frontend only (workspace = apps/*)
pnpm run build               # = build:frontend
pnpm run lint:frontend       # oxlint
pnpm run check:python        # python -m compileall over services/api-python/src
pnpm run check:rust          # cargo check --manifest-path services/api-rust/Cargo.toml
pnpm run check:dotnet        # dotnet build (no-restore) on the WebApplication1 project
pnpm run audit:security      # pnpm audit --audit-level high
```
`check:*` scripts require the respective SDK installed locally; they're thin wrappers,
not full CI parity — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for what actually gates PRs.

### Frontend (`apps/frontend`)
```bash
pnpm --filter frontend dev       # Vite dev server, http://localhost:5173
pnpm --filter frontend lint      # oxlint
pnpm --filter frontend build     # tsc -b && vite build
pnpm --filter frontend preview
```

### API Python (`services/api-python`)
```bash
cd services/api-python
poetry install
poetry run uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload   # http://localhost:8000
```
Requires a `.env` in this directory with at least `SECRET_KEY`, `SESSION_ENC_KEY`,
`SESSION_JWT_SECRET` — the app refuses to boot in production without `SECRET_KEY`
(`settings.require_secret_key()` in `src/app/config.py`). No test suite exists yet
despite pytest/pytest-asyncio/pytest-cov being declared as dev dependencies; CI only
runs `python -m compileall`. Dev-dependency scanners available but not wired into CI:
```bash
poetry run bandit -r src
poetry run pip-audit   # (install separately: not a poetry dependency)
```

### API Rust (`services/api-rust`)
```bash
cd services/api-rust
cargo run             # http://localhost:3000, needs DATABASE_URL (Postgres) and PORT
cargo check --locked
cargo test --locked
```

### API .NET (`services/api-dotnet/WebApplication1`)
```bash
cd services/api-dotnet/WebApplication1
dotnet restore
dotnet run             # http://localhost:8080
dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release
```

### Full stack via Docker
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Ports: frontend `:5173`, api-python `:8000`, api-rust `:3000`, api-dotnet `:8080`,
postgres `:5432`, redis `:6379` (all bound to `127.0.0.1` only). `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
and `REDIS_PASSWORD` are required env vars with no defaults — compose fails fast if
unset.

## Architecture notes

### api-python is the real backend; api-rust/api-dotnet are skeletons
`services/api-python` holds essentially all product logic: full auth stack, Cloudflare
DNS management, and risk scoring. `api-rust` exposes only `/health` and a hello-world
route wired to a Postgres pool; `api-dotnet` is the default ASP.NET minimal-API
template plus `/health`. Don't assume feature parity across services — check
`src/app/main.py` (Python) for the actual mounted routers before assuming a route
exists elsewhere.

### Auth flow (services/api-python/src/app/auth/)
This is the most complex subsystem in the repo. Key files:
- `routes.py` — all `/api/auth/*` endpoints (OAuth start/callback, WebAuthn
  register/login, backup-code recovery, session, consent). Read the module
  docstring — it documents the security model directly.
- `tokens.py` — session issuance/verification. The session cookie value is a JWT
  (HS256, `SESSION_JWT_SECRET`) further encrypted with Fernet (`SESSION_ENC_KEY`),
  so the browser holds an opaque blob it cannot decode even with devtools. Set as
  httpOnly/SameSite=Lax (Secure when `ENV=production`).
  - `providers.py` — OAuth provider registry (Google/Microsoft/GitHub/...);
  `enabled_providers()` reflects whichever client id/secret env vars are set.
- `webauthn.py` — passkey/security-key registration and assertion verification.
- `recovery.py` — one-time backup codes (hashed at rest, popped on redemption).
- `store.py` — **`Store` is an explicit process-local, in-memory placeholder**
  (dict-backed, single-instance/dev only — data is lost on restart and doesn't work
  across multiple instances). The docstring says to swap it for Postgres (users/
  credentials) + Redis (short-lived challenges) without touching `routes.py`, even
  though sqlalchemy/asyncpg/redis are already in `pyproject.toml`. Don't assume
  persistence works beyond a single dev process.

Every OAuth provider uses Authorization Code + PKCE; `state` and `code_verifier`
travel in a short-lived encrypted cookie, never in JS-readable storage.

### Frontend auth client (apps/frontend/src/auth/)
- `authClient.ts` is the single entry point the UI uses for all auth operations; it
  talks to `services/api-python` via `fetch` with `credentials: "include"` so the
  httpOnly session cookie flows automatically. It never touches the session token
  directly — real tokens never reach JS.
- `secureStore.ts` caches only a non-sensitive profile snapshot in IndexedDB,
  encrypted with a non-extractable (`extractable: false`) AES-GCM `CryptoKey`, so not
  even this module's own code can ever export the raw key material. Used as an
  offline fallback in `getSession()` only.
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` selects the backend origin (defaults to
  `http://localhost:8000`).

### Risk scoring / ML (services/api-python/src/ml/)
`src/ml` is not on the main HTTP path except via `RiskModel` (used by
`POST /api/protect/risk-score` in `main.py`). Current implementation is a
deterministic heuristic (SHA-256 hash of the payload normalized to `[0, 1]`) — not a
trained model. It's a placeholder that keeps the public API stable for a real model
later; don't treat its scores as meaningful risk signal.

### Cloudflare DNS management (services/api-python/src/app/routers/dns.py)
Thin proxy over the Cloudflare API v4 (`/zones/{zone_id}/dns_records`) requiring
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`; returns 503 if unconfigured. Also
synced independently via `.github/workflows/cloudflare-dns.yml` in CI.

### Config and secret handling (services/api-python/src/app/config.py)
`Settings` (pydantic-settings) loads from `.env` + environment. `redact()` deep-scrubs
dict/list/tuple/set structures for any key matching password/secret/token/key/
authorization/api_key before logging — reuse it rather than hand-rolling redaction
when logging request/response bodies.

## Security posture (intentional, don't "fix")

- pnpm is locked down hard in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `frozenLockfile`,
  `ignoreScripts`, `strictSsl`, `blockExoticSubdeps`, `minimumReleaseAge: 1440`
  (packages must be 24h old), and `allowBuilds.esbuild: false`. These are
  deliberate supply-chain hardening choices — don't loosen them to unblock an
  install; find the underlying dependency issue instead.
- Session tokens are never stored in localStorage/sessionStorage by design (XSS
  mitigation) — keep new client-side state out of those APIs for anything
  session-related; use `secureStore.ts`'s pattern (non-extractable key,
  IndexedDB) or httpOnly cookies instead.
- All service ports in `docker-compose.yml` bind to `127.0.0.1` only, and
  Postgres/Redis passwords have no defaults (`:?Set ... in .env`) — preserve
  both patterns when adding services.

## CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Four independent jobs, each scoped to one part of the tree — a change to one
service doesn't need the others' toolchains to pass:
- **frontend**: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts` → lint → build
- **python**: Poetry install → `python -m compileall` (no tests currently run in CI)
- **rust**: `cargo check --locked` → `cargo test --locked`
- **dotnet**: `dotnet restore` → `dotnet build --configuration Release`

Two more workflows: `cloudflare-dns.yml` (DNS sync) and `npm-pnpm-security.yml`
(dependency security scanning).
